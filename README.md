# littlenodedatabase
A small and simple nodejs database!

This is a lightweight database built on NodeJs packages! 

Reasons to use littlenodedatabase:
1. Administrative and Read-Only keys for easy access depending on need.
2. Very lightweight, under 150 lines of code.
3. Simple well-known json requests managing/interacting with the database.

Thank you for checking out my project (: It is still in development, so expect some updates in the close, or far future!
